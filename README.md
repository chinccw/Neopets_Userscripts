--some clarification--<br>
if you just open a neopets game/page and try to close tab immediately, it probably won't prompt you the confirmation message. <br>
this is because the 'beforeunload' Event need user interaction (like clicking a link or pressing the back button) to work as intended.<br>
just try to click on some link that navigate you to another page, or just start play the game. after that it should prompt a message before you close tab.<br>
